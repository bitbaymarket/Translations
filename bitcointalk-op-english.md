Decentralized Markets
Smart Contracts


DECENTRALIZED MARKETS

BitBay features an in-wallet marketplace much like Amazon, Alibaba, Freelancer, Odesk and eBay which will utilize it's own cryptocurrency (BitBay). Not only can users buy and sell goods, but they are able to barter anything, make unbreakable agreements, employ people, and buy and sell coins for cash peer to peer with no middle men or fees right within the open source software. Think of this like a combination of ALL popular services on the internet, like Craigslist combined with Ebay Alibaba and Odesk. Thanks to our deal with Halo smart contracting technology, BitBay users are able to buy/sell art, skills, talents, or any other valued commodity. They don't even need to use cryptocurrency and can simply barter on top of the contract. You can even form a farm co-op, perform trusted wires(which is useful for businesses like Telcom) or even sell real estate.
Simply put, the world of commerce is about to change. The BitBay platform is set to completely decentralize the way merchant services and online auctions are done through the internet. BitBay will provide much of the world with a first taste of how crucial it is to utilize the Blockchain when doing business between two parties. Never again will there be a lost contract, invoice, receipt, will, notary, or any other binding agreement. It's all there, searchable, and completely trans- parent.
The BitBay project weaves together Smart Contracts, Multi-Sig technology, and Reputation Vetting all tied into a unbreakable marketplace located off the BitBay Blockchain. Therefore, this system can scale to large volumes thanks to Halo's system of reducing bloat and peer to peer smart contracts. The power of such a marketplace has no boundaries. This is the revolution of free trade.


SMART CONTRACT

The general concept behind Smart Contract technology was first conceived by Mr. Nick Szabo in the mid 1990's. Since that time, there have been many softÂ­ware engineers, theorists, and cryptographers working diligently to crack the code and find the best way to make this dream a reality. Fast forward 20 years, and individuals such as David Zimbeck, Peter Todd and others have begun to fulfill their dreams.
These contracts are unbreakable, enforceable, and completely secure while simultaneously giving equal rights to both parties involved in them. This is the only non-violent two party solution to enforcing agreements in existence. The way it works is quite simple and was first debuted in David Zimbeck's BitHalo contracting software. Both parties make a good faith deposit before entering into the contract. This way, they must work together and it is absolutely impossible to lie or steal in these contracts. Never again will you receive an empty box from E-Bay. Never again will you deal with an unfair judgement of an arbiter. People who you hire from other countries can no longer be late, miss deadlines or come into the job unqualified. And finally your employers must pay you for completed work. Because failure to do so would cost more to the other party. So come aboard the BitBay ship and see what cryptocurrency is really capable of way beyond what you ever imagined!
